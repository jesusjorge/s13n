Broadcast Announce Service
==========================
Using public key digital signatures, broadcast announcements to
any listener on the same broadcast segment.

{preferences}
  1.- Use UDP Port 49411 in Broadcast mode
  2.- UniqueProviderIdentifier could be SHA256 hash of the Provider Certificate
  3.- Signature could be the RSASHA256 signature, generated from the Provider's Public Key Certificate
  4.- Use RSA4096 bit
  5.- Use any type of certificate in Pem format (Base64)
{notes}
  1.- Provider Certificates/Asymetric key could be RSA, since ECDSA is more dificult to implement for purposes
      other than signing messages. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57087599/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-in-android-using-the-elliptic-curve-key-pair-of)
{format}
  Defined in BIFFList format (jesusjorge/s13n/2.1 *|https://github.com/jesusjorge/s13n/blob/main/2.1%20BIFF)
  Variable Length Field definition (jesusjorge/s13n/1.2 *|https://github.com/jesusjorge/s13n/blob/main/1.2%20Variable%20Length%20Field)
  
  1.- ProviderId:DefinedLengthField (Recomendation; Use the SHA256 hash of the Provider Certificate in PEM format)
  2.- Timestamp:Uint64 8 bytes (milliseconds since epoch time)
  3.- Key:DefinedLengthField
  4.- Value:DefinedLengthField
  5.- Signature:DefinedLengthField (Recomendation; Signature could be the RSASHA256 signature, generated from the Provider's Public Key Certificate)

{rules}
      Should only take for valid the announcement with the biggest Timestamp
      Store on disk the last valid announcement from the given provider.
      Biggest timestamp should NOT be stored in disk.
        (Reason: 2K/Y2038 type errors can be fixed with a simple "Rollover/Restart")
      Always check the signature, otherwise ignore it
{use cases}
      Announcements are intended for scenarios where IP addresses are not
      fixed, and internet is not available. Provides a method for updating 
      client configuration on such scenarios.
{limitations}
      ONLY for scenarios where devices share the same broadcast segment.
